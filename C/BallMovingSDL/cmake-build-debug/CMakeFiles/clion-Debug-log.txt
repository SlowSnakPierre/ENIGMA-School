CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Users/thblt/AppData/Local/Programs/CLion Nova/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SDL2_image)
  does not match the name of the calling package (SDL2_IMAGE).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  C:/Users/thblt/AppData/Local/Programs/CLion Nova/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/FindSDL2_image.cmake:91 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
